Some of the AndEngine examples converted to live wallpapers.

AccelerometerSpriteActivity = sprite position altered by accelerometer (tilting the device)
BallActivity = ball infinitely bouncing off camera bounds
WallpaperActivity = few parallax entities in a scene

Notes:
- use GPU emulation on device > 4.0.3
- thanks to Morlicando (https://github.com/morlicando/Wallpaper-example-Andengine-GLES2) for the original working code (used in WallpaperActivity)
